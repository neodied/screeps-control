"main" should just initialize the kernel and tell it to run the next process while we've still got CPU and processes to run, then "shut down" the kernel at the end of the tick.

kernel has a process table, schedules the processes by priority, and manages/records how much CPU we've used so far this tick.

init - spawn essential/progenitor processes for that tick.
  - memory management
  - room managers
  - queues up the "suspension" task for all un-completed processes at the end of the tick

memory management process handles cleanup and memory structure. until I figure out or realize a need for anything more complex, it will just keep creeps cleaned up out of memory.

room managers - manage room needs and mechanics, spawns subprocesses:
  - energy management
  - spawn management
  - construction management
  - conflict management
  - room memory data management
